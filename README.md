## Info
This is UNOFFICIAL Anker Soundcore Life Headphone api. I am Not partner with Soundcore in anyway


## Devices Supported
"Anker Soundcore Life Q30 was the only device i own so i can only test that one BUT Other device such as Q35 should work"
- Anker Soundcore Life Q30

## SoundcoreDesktop
I've made a SoundcoreDesktop app here is what it looks like
Inorder to use this you need to download the `SoundcoreDesktop` folder once it's done,
You will need to get your Device MacAddress which you can find them in the Bluetooth setting
after that is done you will need to open the main.py and click on settings button it should open
a new Window It should have a input box that box you need to insert your address you found and click Submit.
Now you should be able to control your Device on your desktop!

Also The images from the GUI Are from taken from Soundcore App itself (APK)

Notes if the Soundcore Mobile app is open and connected to the Headphone then the desktop will NOT Work
the Soundcore Device seems only support 1 app controlled at a time so just exit out the Mobile app and this
should work. Also This SoundcoreDesktop app is not 100% complete, If you would like to help out this project
feel free make a PR Thanks.
